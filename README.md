# Home-automation-using-TCS34725-RGB-Sensor
Please be aware that the code works under the assumption that you have the SmartLightBulbLibrary library, which offers functions for controlling the smart light bulb. Replace it with the proper code or library for your particular home automation system. Additionally, confirm that the TCS34725 sensor and your microcontroller are connected properly.

To run the code you mentioned, follow these steps:

1. Set up the Arduino IDE: If you haven't already, download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Launch the Arduino IDE once it's installed.

2. Install the required libraries: In the Arduino IDE, go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries". In the Library Manager, search for "Adafruit TCS34725" and click the "Install" button to install the library. Additionally, if you're using a specific home automation library, make sure to install it as well.

3. Connect the hardware: Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure you have the TCS34725 color sensor connected to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board (SCL to analog 5, SDA to analog 4, VDD to 3.3V, and GROUND to ground).

4. Select the board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to "Tools" -> "Board" and select the appropriate Arduino board you are using. Then, go to "Tools" -> "Port" and select the serial port to which your Arduino board is connected.

5. Open a new sketch: In the Arduino IDE, go to "File" -> "New" to open a new sketch.

6. Copy and paste the code: Copy the modified code you received earlier and paste it into the new sketch window in the Arduino IDE.

7. Verify and upload the sketch: Click the "Verify" button (checkmark icon) to compile the code. Ensure that there are no compilation errors. Once the code is successfully compiled, click the "Upload" button (right arrow icon) to upload the code to your Arduino board. The Arduino IDE will compile the code again and upload it to the board.

8. Monitor the output: After the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor by clicking on the magnifying glass icon in the upper-right corner of the Arduino IDE window. Set the baud rate to 9600 to match the code's `Serial.begin(9600);`. You should see the color temperature, lux, and color readings printed in the serial monitor.

9. Observe the home automation actions: Depending on the modified code, the smart light bulb or home automation actions should respond to the color readings from the TCS34725 sensor. Make sure your smart light bulb or home automation system is properly set up and connected.
By following these steps, you should be able to run the modified code for your home automation project using the TCS34725 color sensor.
